### Repository Structure
This repository organizes different programming assignments done during my first semester into individual folders for each subject. Each folder contains a README with an overview and details of the key tasks performed. The structure is designed to showcase a progression of skills in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. All projects done by me, all summaries done by ChatGPT.

### Reinforcement Learning
Fifth semester course. 

Covered reinforcement learning algorithms and decision-making methods, including k-Armed Bandit problems, Dynamic Programming (Policy Iteration, Value Iteration), Monte Carlo methods, Temporal Difference learning (SARSA, Q-Learning), and Policy Gradient methods (REINFORCE, REINFORCE with Baseline). Assignments focused on implementing and analyzing these techniques in environments like CliffWalking, Blackjack, and CartPole-v1.

### Algorithms and Data Structures 2
Third semester course. 

Covered key algorithms and data structures, including AVL trees (self-balancing binary search trees), chaining hash sets (collision resolution using linked lists), Dijkstra's algorithm (shortest paths in graphs), and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (maximum flow in networks). Assignments focused on implementing and analyzing these algorithms with practical applications in graph traversal, flow networks, and efficient data management.

###  Artificial Intelligence  
Third semester course.  

Covered search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, and heuristic methods), game-playing strategies (Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, Q-Learning), decision trees (ID3 algorithm), and Bayesian networks (probabilistic inference). Assignments included implementing algorithms for problem-solving, decision-making, and probabilistic reasoning.
