File: Dijkstra.py

Description:
This file contains the implementation of various classes to model and manipulate a graph. 
It includes:
- Node: Represents a graph node with a name.
- Edge: Represents a weighted, undirected edge connecting two nodes.
- Step: Represents a step in a path, including the covered distance.
- Graph: A general graph structure with methods to manage nodes and edges.
- JKUMap: A specific graph implementation modeling a map of locations and their connections.

Classes and Key Functionalities:
1. **Node**:
   - Represents a node in the graph.
   - Supports equality comparison and hashing based on the node name.

2. **Edge**:
   - Represents an undirected, weighted connection between two nodes.
   - Ensures edges are treated as equal irrespective of node order.

3. **Step**:
   - Models a step in a path with a reference to the node and the distance covered to reach it.

4. **Graph**:
   - A generic graph implementation supporting:
     - Adding nodes and edges.
     - Querying nodes, edges, neighbors.
     - Finding nodes and edges by name.

5. **JKUMap (Extends Graph)**:
   - A concrete implementation of a graph modeling specific locations (e.g., "Spar", "LIT", "Porter").
   - Predefines nodes and edges representing connections between locations.
   - Includes methods (some to be implemented):
     - get_shortest_path: Determines the shortest path between two nodes.
     - get_shortest_distances: Finds shortest distances from a start node to all nodes.
     - reachable: Checks if there exists a path between two nodes.
     - init_shortest_path_structures: Initializes structures for shortest path calculations.
     - dijkstra: An optional method for Dijkstra's algorithm.

TODO:
- Implement the methods in JKUMap marked with #TODO.

Usage:
- This module can be used for educational purposes or extended for more advanced graph operations.
