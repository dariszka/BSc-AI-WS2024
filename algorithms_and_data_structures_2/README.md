# **Assignment 1 - AVL Tree Implementation**

### Overview
Implemented an **AVL tree**, a self-balancing binary search tree, focusing on maintaining balance during dynamic insertions and deletions.

### Key Tasks
- **Node Management**: Added, removed, and searched nodes while ensuring the AVL tree properties were maintained.
- **Balance Maintenance**:
  - Calculated and updated heights of nodes after modifications.
  - Restructured subtrees dynamically using single and double rotations to restore balance.
- **Auxiliary Functions**: Developed helper methods for parent-child reassignments and tree traversal to facilitate efficient operations.

# **Assignment 2 - Chaining Hash Set**

### Overview
Implemented a **chaining hash set**, focusing on efficient key storage and collision handling using linked lists.

### Key Tasks
- **Hash Function**: Calculated hash codes using modulo division to map keys to table indices.
- **Collision Resolution**: Managed linked lists in buckets to handle collisions effectively.
- **Core Operations**: Developed methods for insertion, search, deletion, and clearing the table.
- **Table Representation**: Created a function to display the hash table and its contents in a readable format.
