# A1 - Uninformed Search Algorithms

### Overview
This assignment focuses on the implementation and analysis of various uninformed search algorithms for problem-solving, applied to a maze-solving task. 

### Key Tasks

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - Implemented BFS to explore all possible paths, level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.

- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
  - Used a priority queue to explore nodes based on path cost, ensuring the least-cost path is found.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - Implemented DFS using a stack to explore as deeply as possible before backtracking.
  - Compared DFS with BFS to understand their performance in different maze configurations.

- **Depth-Limited Depth-First Search (DLDFS)**
  - Introduced a depth limit to DFS, preventing it from going beyond a specified depth.
  - Implemented a recursive approach to handle depth limits.

- **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDS)**
  - Combined the strengths of DFS and BFS by incrementally increasing the depth limit in each iteration.
  - Ensured optimality while avoiding the memory limitations of BFS.
